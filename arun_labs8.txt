grep commands

1.ceate a file using cat command
2.enter some bits into the file and then perform the grep option available
  -V, --version
              Output the version number of grep and exit.
  -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular  expression  (ERE,  see
              below).

  -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings (instead of regular
              expressions), separated by newlines,  any  of  which  is  to  be
              matched.

  -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  a  basic  regular  expression  (BRE, see
              below).  This is the default.

  -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret the pattern as a  Perl-compatible  regular  expression
              (PCRE).    This   is  experimental  and  grep  -P  may  warn  of
              unimplemented features.
  -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use PATTERN as the pattern.  If this  option  is  used  multiple
              times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all
              patterns given.  This option can be used to  protect  a  pattern
              beginning with “-”.

  -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used
              multiple times or is combined with  the  -e  (--regexp)  option,
              search  for  all  patterns  given.  The empty file contains zero
              patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

  -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions, so that characters that differ only in
              case match each other.


1.character* -display 0 or more matches.
2.character+ -display one or more matches.
3.character? -display 0 or 1 match.
4. .* -none or anything.
5. ^character -display the bits starting with the mentioned letter.
6. character$ -display the bits ending with the mentioned letter.
